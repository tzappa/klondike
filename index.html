				Empty Tableau piles may be filled with a King or a pile starting with a King.</p>
			<p>Stock: Click to deal one card. The Stock can be re-dealt as many times as needed.</p>
			<p>Waste: Cards from the Stock are dealt to the Waste pile. Cards in the Waste pile are available for play on the Foundations or Tableau piles.</p>
